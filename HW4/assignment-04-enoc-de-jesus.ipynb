    "## Assignment 04: Advanced Git\n",
    "### Due 02 October 2024\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will explore Git in more depth, focusing on commands we have not covered in class. You should research how to solve each task using specific Git commands. Feel free to use any tools you prefer to complete the assignment. Explain each command in simple terms. Of course, you are welcome to test them as well! If you have any questions, please let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What command would you use to display all the commits that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository?\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Explain the purpose of the `git tag` command.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. How do you remove a file from the repository history?\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. How do you temporarily save your changes without committing them?\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. How do you amend the most recent commit message?\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. How can you split a commit into multiple commits?\n",
    "   \n",
    "7. How do you display the changes between two branches?\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. What command would you use to see which remote repository a local repository is connected to?\n",
    "   \n",
    "9.  Explain the difference between `git merge` and `git rebase`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. How can you search for a specific commit message?"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "1. I've learned you can use the command \n",
    "git log origin/branch_name..branch_name\n",
    "and if I want to display all of them, I can do \n",
    "git log origin/master..master\n",
    "If the main branches were main, switch them to main stead. git log shows the commit history, and .. compares the two branches, to see which commit history is different. Since both will have pushed commits and branch_name will have the non-pushed commits, it will show the non-pushed commits only. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can use git tag to create tags and see which were created. Tags are useful to mark a commit, knowing when significant commits were made which are useful as reference points. \n",
    "git tag tag_name \n",
    "makes the tag, and \n",
    "git tag\n",
    "shows all the tags made. You can do other stuff with git tag, such as \n",
    "git tag -a tag_name -m \"message\" \n",
    "which makes a tag with name, email, date, and message, and also delete with \n",
    "git tag -d tag_name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are a couple of ways to do this but it seems like using filter-repo is the newest and best way to. I had to install git-filter-repo and then do the following command:\n",
    "git filter-repo --path file_name --invert-paths \n",
    "with file_name being the file you want to remove from the history. Sometimes you have to force it to with\n",
    "git push origin--force -all\n",
    "\n",
    "4. I can use the git stash command, it stores the changes and reverts the directory to the last commit. You can also use \n",
    "git stash list\n",
    "to show you a list of all stashed changes, and\n",
    "git stash apply\n",
    "to get them back.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. I can use\n",
    "git commit --amend -m \"new message\"\n",
    "Just like a normal commit, but the --amend lets you amend to the commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. I can use git reset. git reset undos changes I made in the repository, both for commits and the staging area. I can do\n",
    "git reset HEAD^ \n",
    "to undo the most recent commit. After that, i use git add to add the first part I want to commit to the staging area, and then commit it. I keep doing that for each split I want to commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. I can use the git diff command, which is\n",
    "git diff branch1..branch2\n",
    "Similar to 1, the diff and .. finds the differences in contents between branch1 and branch2. For whatever is not shared between them, it will show.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. I can use \n",
    "git remote -v \n",
    "to see which remote repositories I fetch and pull to. For more information, I can use \n",
    "git remote show origin \n",
    "instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Git merge merges branch_1 onto the branch your in, and both branches are still in tact, along with the merge history being perserved as the commits are separate. \n",
    "git rebase doesn't keep the histories in tact. In git rebase, you are in branch_1, and you tell where you want to rebase, for example\n",
    "get checkout branch_1\n",
    "git rebase main\n",
    "Git rebase then removes the commits you made on branch_1, resets it, and then the commits are reapplied on top of the main branch. This in turn rewrites the commit history, and no merge commit is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of merging the branch onto main while knowing when the merge commit happened, preserving branch history, you make a linear commit history in main as if no merge happened. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. You can use\n",
    "git log --grep=\"search_term\"\n",
    "In here, git log will find the commit history, and then --grep will search for commits that contain \"search_term\""
